## ðŸ“£ Random Quote from characters of the Office TV Series (US version)

> I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I donâ€™t have a butler, I do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.
