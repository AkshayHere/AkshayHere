## 📣 Random Quote from characters of the Office TV Series (US version)

> I don't talk trash; I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is all hypothetical, like, 'Your Mama's so fat she could eat the internet', but smack talk is happening like right now, like, 'You're ugly and I know it for a fact 'cause I got the evidence right there.'
