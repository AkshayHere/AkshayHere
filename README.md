> My philosophy is, basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Donâ€™t, ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or, or where youâ€™ve been. Ever. For any reason. Whatsoever.
