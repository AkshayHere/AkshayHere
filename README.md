## ðŸ“£ Random Quote from characters of the Office TV Series (US version)

> I fell in love with these kids. And I didnâ€™t want to see them fall victim to the system. So I made â€™em a promise. I told them if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I have made some empty promises in my life but, hands down, that was the most generous.
