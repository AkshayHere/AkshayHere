## ðŸ“£ Random Quote from characters of the Office TV Series (US version)

> No, donâ€™t call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs and get a distress call from the Commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.
